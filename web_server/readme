--> How to create a simple web server
 [code]
 var http = require('http');
 http.createServer(function (request, response) {
    response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
    response.end('Hello World\n');
}).listen(8124,'localhost');
 console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8124/');
 [/code]


  You can choose to give a port on which this server listens
  giving URL is optional. In case we don't specify default would be localhost.
  Run in node terrminal as
  > Node filename
       OR
  if GIT BASH
  > npm start

  Now you can navigate to browser at http://127.0.0.1:8124/ to see result Hello World
